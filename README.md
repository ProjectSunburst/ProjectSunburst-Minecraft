# Project Sunburst - Minecraft

This repository is where the server core, and the plugin api lives.

The goal of the project is to share my vision on what a freedom server should look like.

Giving players ops does not equal to giving them freedom - they are being restricted. The idea of this project is to be able to give players freedom they want without giving them operator access.
